# Custom-Load-Balancer-
This project is a custom load balancer implemented in Python. It uses socket programming and threading to distribute client requests among multiple backend servers. The load balancer supports the Least Connection Algorithm for efficient load distribution and can be extended to support other algorithms like Round Robin.
